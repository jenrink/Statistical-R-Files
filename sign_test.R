# Sign Test

# A sign test is used to decide whether a binomial distribution has the equal chance of success and failure.

# PROBLEM: A soft drink company has invented a new drink, and would like to find out if it will be as popular as the existing favorite drink. For this purpose, its research department arranges 18 participants for taste testing. Each participant tries both drinks in random order before giving his or her opinion. It turns out that 5 of the participants like the new drink better, and the rest prefer the old one. At .05 significance level, can we reject the notion that the two drinks are equally popular?

binom.test(5, 18) 

# Exact binomial test
# 
# data:  5 and 18
# number of successes = 5, number of trials = 18, p-value = 0.09625
# alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#   0.09694921 0.53480197
# sample estimates:
#   probability of success 
# 0.2777778

# ANSWER: At .05 significance level, we do not reject the notion that the two drinks are equally popular.
